</p>

## Overview

The CopyCat capsule is live on the Bixby Marketplace. You can try it out there! This is a slightly different version of CopyCat with dev testing actions and concepts. The tutorial covers default behavior, transience, and flags to help remember and forget concepts during a user's session. The tutorial video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/DZIa5nUmikQ):
